"""Microstack Init

Initialize the databases and configuration files of a microstack
install.

We structure our init in the form of 'Question' classes, each of which
has an 'ask' routine, run in the order laid out in the
question_classes in the main function in this file.

.ask will either ask the user a question, and run the appropriate
routine in the Question class, or simply automatically run a routine
without input from the user (in the case of 'required' questions).
